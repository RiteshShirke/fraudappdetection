# Fraudulent App Detection System

The Fraudulent App Detection System is designed to detect potentially malicious or fraudulent apps on a mobile device. The system uses static and dynamic analysis to scan applications, checks for suspicious permissions and behaviors, and leverages a machine learning model to classify apps as safe or potentially fraudulent.

## Features

1. **App Scanning**
   - **Static Analysis**: Scans installed apps for dangerous permissions, APK anomalies, and suspicious code patterns.
   - **Dynamic Analysis**: Monitors app behavior, such as network traffic, battery consumption, and background activities.

2. **Machine Learning-Based Classification**
   - Train a machine learning model to classify apps as safe, potentially risky, or dangerous based on extracted features.
   
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Continuously monitors new app installations and updates.
   - Alerts users when an app exhibits abnormal behavior.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Provides a list of all installed apps with safety ratings.
   - Allows users to view detailed reports of each app, including permissions, behaviors, and risk levels.

5. **Cloud Integration (Optional)**
   - Sync app data with a cloud-based dashboard.
   - Aggregate data from multiple devices to identify widespread threats.

6. **Report and Feedback System**
   - Allows users to report suspicious apps.
   - Sends feedback to improve the machine learning model.

7. **Security & Privacy**
   - Secure authentication and encrypted communication between the app and the cloud.
   - User data is anonymized and protected to ensure privacy.

## Tech Stack

### Mobile App
- **Frontend**: Flutter for cross-platform development (Android & iOS).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for RESTful APIs.
- **Static Analysis**: Use of Android SDK tools (e.g., AAPT) for APK analysis.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Use of Android's `UsageStatsManager` and network monitoring libraries.

### Machine Learning
- **Training Models**: Python with scikit-learn or TensorFlow for training models.
- **Model Deployment**: Integrate the model into the mobile app using TensorFlow Lite.

### Cloud Services (Optional)
- **Backend**: AWS or Firebase for cloud storage and real-time updates.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing app data, scan results, and user reports.
- **Dashboard**: React.js for a web-based dashboard to monitor app scans.

### Security
- JWT for user authentication.
- HTTPS and SSL for secure communication.
